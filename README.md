# Lyrical
COP3530 Group Project by Olivia Feller, Kattrina Erillo, and Gabriella Neris
Lyrical is a program that allows users to explore the most popular words in songs from a large database of music artists.
The program uses two data structures - a hash table implemented as an unordered map and an AVL tree - and compares the efficiency of the two.
